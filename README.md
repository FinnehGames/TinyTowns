# TinyTowns
TinyTowns is an open-source project that revives the essence of the beloved SmallWorlds social game, which bid farewell in 2018. This repository is dedicated to a complete rewrite and reimagining of the game, aiming to recreate the immersive world where players can craft their own tiny towns.
